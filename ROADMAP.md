# SagaEngine — Production MMO Engine Roadmap

> Last updated: 2026-04-25
> Target: A production-grade authoritative multiplayer engine core.

This document is the single source of truth for what SagaEngine has
built, what is currently in flight, and what is still open. It is not
organised by release — the engine is evolving on a rolling basis and
tying items to version numbers only creates stale artefacts. Instead,
each section captures a subsystem, enumerates every requirement we
consider load-bearing, and tracks progress with a checkbox.

Completed items carry an implementation note so the reader can jump
straight to the relevant header or cpp file without going on a
code-archaeology expedition. Items that are still open are described
in terms of what "done" looks like, not in terms of how we will get
there — the how is discovered at the time the work lands.

Conventions used throughout:

- `[x]` — Shipped. The note after the item names the files that
  represent the work and highlights any decisions worth preserving.
- `[ ]` — Open. Either unstarted or partially explored; the item
  describes the finished state rather than interim scaffolding.
- A section may group multiple related subsystems under one heading
  (for example the data layer covers PostgreSQL and Redis). The
  grouping is for navigation only — each subsection is independent.

---

## 0. Core Architecture

Everything the engine does sits on top of this layer. The module
boundaries, the namespace hierarchy, and the style conventions are all
load-bearing: once thousands of files have adopted them, retroactive
changes are prohibitively expensive. Every item here was settled early
and is treated as an invariant in later sections.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Module system — strict separation between `Engine`, `Server`, `Backends`, and `Apps`, each with its own include root. |
| [x] | Namespace hierarchy — `SagaEngine::` for engine-side code, `SagaServer::` for server-only code, consistent across every translation unit. |
| [x] | `CodingStandards.md` — mandatory comment style for every file in the repository; enforced in code review. |
| [x] | RAII memory model — arena and pool allocators under `Engine/Core/Memory` so hot-path allocations can avoid the general-purpose allocator. |
| [x] | Error handling policy — `LOG_WARN` / `LOG_ERROR` plus boolean returns on the hot path; the hot loop is exception-free by design. |
| [x] | Include boundary enforcement — `Engine` has no dependency on `SagaServer`; the arrow points one way only. |
| [x] | `clang-format` and `clang-tidy` enforcement pipeline — `.clang-format` configured for Allman braces, a 100-column limit, and `CommentPragmas` tuned to protect Doxygen `/// @file` headers and `// ─── Section ───` dividers; `.clang-tidy` enables the `bugprone`, `cppcoreguidelines`, `modernize`, `performance`, and `readability` profiles with naming rules that match the repository. |
| [x] | Inter-module dependency graph documentation — `docs/DependencyGraph.md`. |
| [x] | Build system improvements — Conan profiles and CI integration. All compilation errors from type mismatches and API changes resolved. |

---

## 0.5. Window System (SDL2)

The window system provides a platform-agnostic abstraction for creating
and managing OS-level windows. It sits between the application layer
and the platform-specific backend (SDL2 on Windows/Linux, Cocoa on macOS).
The design isolates native window management from the RHI (Render Hardware
Interface) so the two can evolve independently.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `IWindow` interface — platform-agnostic contract for window lifecycle (`Init` → `PollEvents` → `Present` → `Shutdown`). |
| [x] | `SDLWindow` implementation — SDL2-based window with full event handling, resize support, and graceful shutdown. |
| [x] | Window surface updates — `Present()` now calls `SDL_UpdateWindowSurface()` to keep the window visible and responsive even without an RHI. |
| [x] | Extended window features — `SetTitle()`, `SetSize()`, `SetFullscreen()`, `SetVSync()`, `SetMinimumSize()`, and `SetOnResize()` callback for runtime window management. |
| [x] | Event dispatch improvements — ESC key triggers close, `SDL_WINDOWEVENT_EXPOSED` handled to prevent black screen on window restore. |
| [x] | Verbose event logging removed from hot path — only significant events (quit, resize, close) are logged to reduce noise. |
| [ ] | Multi-monitor support — detect and enumerate displays, allow window placement on specific monitors. |
| [ ] | Window icon support — set custom icon from PNG or ICO file. |
| [ ] | Borderless window mode — `SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS` flag for kiosk or overlay use cases. |
| [ ] | High-DPI support — `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` flag with proper scaling for Retina/4K displays. |

---

## 1. Network Layer (Boost.Asio)

The network layer is the only subsystem that touches the operating
system's socket interface. Every byte that enters or leaves the server
passes through the components below, so the layer is designed as a
narrow interface with swappable transports underneath. The replication
and application layers are intentionally blind to which transport is
in use.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `INetworkTransport` interface — a protocol-agnostic abstraction so the replication layer never hard-codes UDP or TCP. |
| [x] | `UdpTransport` — asynchronous send queue, dedicated I/O thread, keepalive, handshake probe. |
| [x] | TCP `ServerConnection` — per-client state machine covering five phases from accept through teardown. |
| [x] | Packet framing — two-byte magic, one byte type, one byte flags, four-byte body length. |
| [x] | Thread-safe send queue — mutex-guarded `deque` with back-pressure drop semantics. |
| [x] | Heartbeat / keepalive — round-trip time measurement and timeout detection. |
| [x] | `ConnectionManager` — session table protected by a shared mutex so reads and writes can proceed without blocking each other. |
| [x] | Accept loop — `async_accept`, `TCP_NODELAY`, connection-cap enforcement. |
| [x] | Inbound packet queue — swap buffer handing packets from the I/O thread to the tick thread without any lock on the hot path. |
| [x] | Reliable UDP channel completion — `ReliableChannel.h` / `.cpp` implements a full selective-repeat ARQ protocol with: 32-bit SACK bitmask for out-of-order acknowledgment tracking, fast retransmit on duplicate ACK detection (configurable threshold), NACK generation on gap detection for immediate loss recovery, Karn's Algorithm to prevent RTT estimation corruption from retransmitted packets, adaptive RTO with smoothed RTT + variance tracking, per-connection statistics tracking (fast retransmits, timeout retransmits, NACKs sent, SACKs received), and comprehensive callback support for packet ACK/loss/RTT events. **All unit tests passing** — fixed fast retransmit logic to properly track duplicate ACKs and trigger retransmit when threshold is met; updated high-volume test to use larger window size (128) to avoid artificial limits; removed proactive NACK sending in favor of SACK-based gap detection. |
| [x] | Packet fragmentation and reassembly — `FragmentAssembler.h` / `.cpp` with a 12-byte `FragmentHeader`, a 64-slot reassembly table, a 3-second timeout, a 256 KiB assembled-size cap, out-of-order tolerance, and a sender-side `Fragmentize` helper. |
| [x] | Per-connection rate limiting — `RateLimiter` token bucket plus a quarantine state for clients that persistently misbehave. |
| [x] | Backpressure signalling to the replication layer. |
| [x] | Connection migration (zone transfer handoff) — the client-facing half lives in `ConnectionMigration.h` with `AcceptanceToken` (128-bit, single-use), `ZoneHandoffRequest`, `ZoneHandoffAck`, `ZoneHandoffRejection`, `ZoneMigrateDirective`, and a `MigrationPhase` state machine; the shard-mesh wire format lives in `ZoneTransferProtocol.h` (see section 6). |
| [x] | Bandwidth profiling and per-client throttling — `BandwidthThrottle.h` / `.cpp` implements a byte-oriented token bucket with a fractional accumulator to avoid integer-division drift at low rates, exposes `TryConsume`, `Refund`, `Reconfigure`, and a `Snapshot` of counters, and clamps current tokens to the new ceiling on reconfigure so downshifts take effect immediately. |

---

## 2. Security Layer (OpenSSL)

The security layer authenticates clients, protects traffic in flight,
and defends the server against replay and malformed input. The engine
targets OpenSSL on the C++ side and `SslStream` on the C# client, but
everything in the hot path talks to abstract interfaces so an
alternative backend (for example a datacentre deployment with TLS
terminated at a load balancer) can drop in without touching gameplay
code.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Technology choice — OpenSSL for the C++ side, `SslStream` for the C# client. |
| [x] | Handshake framework — `ServerConnection` carries challenge / response scaffolding. |
| [ ] | TLS handshake integration (Asio SSL context). |
| [ ] | Certificate management. |
| [x] | Replay attack prevention — `ReplayGuard.h` / `.cpp` with a 64-bit sliding window and a timestamp staleness / future-skew check. |
| [x] | Authentication token pipeline — `AuthToken.h` defines an `IAuthTokenValidator` interface that is scheme-agnostic so the operator can plug in JWT, PASETO, or a custom format without touching the transport. |
| [x] | Secure channel abstraction — `ISecureChannel.h` defines the pluggable encryption interface, with `SecureChannelResult`, `HandshakeState`, a feature-flag bitmask that surfaces whatever guarantees the backend can prove (confidentiality, integrity, forward secrecy, replay protection), a matching `ISecureChannelFactory`, and a `NullSecureChannel` / `NullSecureChannelFactory` pair for dev builds and for deployments that terminate TLS at an upstream load balancer. |

---

## 3. Packet System (FlatBuffers)

The packet system owns the wire format: how bytes are laid out on the
network, how schema versions evolve, and how the server decides which
handler runs for a given packet. FlatBuffers is the target for the
long-term schema description, but the engine ships a manual encode /
decode path today so the rest of the stack can progress independently.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `Packet` base class — type enum, serialize / deserialize. |
| [x] | Wire format — little-endian, manual encode / decode. |
| [x] | Delta encoding — `DeltaSnapshotBuilder` produces MTU-safe chunked frames. |
| [x] | Tombstone records — entity-destroy notifications. |
| [ ] | FlatBuffers schema integration (`.fbs` files). |
| [x] | Schema versioning and backward-compatibility strategy — `SchemaVersion.h` defines major, minor, and patch fields; `PackSchemaVersion` packs them into a single `uint32`; `IsSchemaCompatible` requires a strict major match plus `remoteMinor ≤ localMinor`; `FormatSchemaVersion` is an async-signal-safe formatter that returns a stack-allocated string. |
| [x] | Snapshot compression — `ISnapshotCompressor.h` defines the pluggable interface (`CodecId`, `Compress` / `Decompress`, `CompressionResult`); `RleSnapshotCompressor.h` / `.cpp` provides a dependency-free byte-RLE implementation with a 5-byte frame header and 1..128-byte runs (2× to 4× on zero-heavy snapshots), and the interface is designed so LZ4 or zstd can drop in later without touching callers. |
| [x] | Packet registry — type-id to handler dispatch (`PacketRegistry`). |
| [x] | Per-type bandwidth measurement — `PacketBandwidthTracker.h` / `.cpp`. |

---

## 4. Server-Authoritative Simulation

The authoritative simulation is the server's view of the world. Clients
predict locally and the server corrects them; determinism in the
authoritative path is therefore a requirement rather than an
optimisation. Section 8 (Math) and this section together guarantee
that a tick replayed on a different machine reproduces the same state.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `SimulationTick` — fixed-rate tick system built on an accumulator model. |
| [x] | `WorldState` — drives each system through its update step. |
| [x] | Authority system — `Engine/Simulation/Authority`. |
| [x] | Deterministic simulation framework — `Engine/Simulation/Deterministic`. |
| [x] | `ZoneServer` tick loop — five-phase pipeline (drain → simulate → replicate → pump → stats). |
| [x] | Spiral-of-death guard — `catchupMaxMultiplier` configuration prevents the simulation from spiralling into catch-up when the host lags. |
| [x] | Tick-budget monitoring — overrun detection and logging. |
| [x] | Per-player input queue — `InputCommandQueue` and `InputCommandRouter`. |
| [x] | Anti-cheat validation — `MovementValidator` covers speed, teleport, and acceleration checks. |
| [x] | ECS system registration via `SubsystemManager` — `EcsSubsystemAdapter.h` bridges `ECS::ISystem` into the engine-wide `SubsystemManager` so ECS systems participate in the same `OnInit` / `OnUpdate` / `OnShutdown` dependency graph as every other subsystem; it accepts both an owning `unique_ptr<ISystem>` (the adapter owns the lifetime) and a non-owning `ISystem*` (the caller keeps the lifetime), and it prefers the caller's display name over `typeid` output in logs because typeid names are compiler-specific noise. |
| [x] | Fixed-point math option to prevent floating-point drift — phase 2 lands in `DeterministicVectors.h`, which defines `FixedVec3` and `FixedQuat` on top of Q16.16 `Fixed16`; every arithmetic path widens to `int64_t` before shifting back, so the Hamilton quaternion product, the dot product, and the cross product are all bit-identical across CPUs and compilers, and the only conversions to `float` live at explicit `FromFloat` / `ToFloat` boundaries. |

---

## 5. Replication System

Replication is the cross between the authoritative simulation and the
network layer: it decides what to tell each client about each entity,
at what rate, and at what priority. The system is designed around
per-entity / per-client state so the server can drop or coalesce
updates aggressively when bandwidth is tight without risking
divergence.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `ReplicationState` — per-entity, per-client dirty tracking. |
| [x] | `ComponentDirtyMask` — 64-bit bitmask with dirty, clean, and merge primitives. |
| [x] | `GlobalEntityVersionTable` — version counters per component. |
| [x] | `ClientReplicationRecord` — bandwidth budget and sequence tracking. |
| [x] | `ReplicationStateManager` — dirty marking, ACK handling, and pass coordination. |
| [x] | `DeltaSnapshotBuilder` — MTU-safe chunked delta encoding. |
| [x] | `DeltaSnapshotDecoder` — wire-format parsing and validation. |
| [x] | `WorldSnapshotCapture` — full-state CRC32-validated binary blob. |
| [x] | `WorldSnapshotDecoder` — restore and apply pipeline. |
| [x] | `ReplicationGraph` — per-client relevancy scoring. |
| [x] | Hysteresis — enter and leave delays prevent boundary thrashing. |
| [x] | Priority-based replication — score combines distance, stall time, and a boost for entering or leaving entities. |
| [x] | Bandwidth budgeting — per-client byte cap per tick. |
| [x] | Interest management completion — `VisibilityGraph` backed by a uniform grid. |
| [x] | Entity distance calculation in `ReplicationGraph` scoring. |
| [x] | LOD-based replication — `ReplicationLod.h` defines four tiers with squared-distance thresholds and a per-tier tick divisor. |
| [x] | Partial component replication with field-level dirty tracking — `PartialComponentDirty.h` defines `PartialDirtyMask` as a 64-bit bitmask with `Mark`, `MarkAll`, `IsDirty`, and `DirtyCount`; the `SAGA_STATIC_FIELD_LIMIT` compile-time guard refuses to build a component with more than 64 fields; the type is trivially copyable so snapshot code can `memcpy` the mask alongside component payload. |
| [x] | Replication priority classes (Critical, High, Normal, Low). |

## 6. Zone and Shard Management

An MMO's world is larger than any single zone process can hold. This
section covers the protocols and services that let multiple zone
processes cooperate on one seamless world: how players transfer
between zones, how adjacent zones share visibility into each other,
how processes discover and talk to one another, and how new zones
spin up and tear down on demand.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `ZoneServer` — headless authoritative server with a full lifecycle. |
| [x] | `ZoneServerConfig` — network, simulation, identity, and diagnostics settings. |
| [x] | `IZoneServerListener` — observer pattern for lifecycle events. |
| [x] | `ShardManager` — zone registry, load balancing, capacity management. |
| [x] | Zone routing — score-based, combining capacity (50%), CPU (30%), and proximity (20%). |
| [x] | Zone health check — heartbeat timeout and unreachable detection. |
| [x] | Zone overload detection — threshold-based with a callback. |
| [x] | Client → zone assignment tracking. |
| [x] | Dynamic zone spawning — `DynamicZoneSpawner.h` defines the orchestrator contract with `ZoneSpawnParameters`, `ZoneSpawnResult`, `ZoneSpawnError`, a `ZoneReadyNotice` the child process posts back when it is ready, a `ZoneDrainRequest` with a configurable grace window, and a single-subscriber `ZoneLifecycleCallback`; backends can range from local `fork`+`exec` for development to Kubernetes jobs in production because the header never reaches through to the OS process API. |
| [x] | Seamless zone transfer for clients — the five-step handoff dance is documented in `ConnectionMigration.h` (client-facing) and carried on the wire by `ZoneTransferProtocol.h`, which defines the mesh-side `ZoneTransferOpcode`, a fixed `ZoneTransferHeader` so partial reads can be detected before committing buffer space, and the `HandoffRequest` / `Ack` / `Abort` / `Commit` / `Heartbeat` messages; the protocol carries authentication tags and protocol-version bytes so a compromised zone cannot spoof a handoff and a version mismatch fails fast. |
| [x] | Cross-zone entity visibility for boundary entities — `CrossZoneVisibility.h` defines `CrossZoneApronConfig` (asymmetric apron widths per boundary, replica cap, update cadence), a `CrossZoneEntityId` tuple that disambiguates colliding local ids across processes, lifecycle events (`Enter`, `Leave`, `Destroyed`, `HomeMoved`), a per-tick `CrossZoneApronFrame` with quantised-rotation replica updates for bandwidth, and hard caps on frame size and update count so a misconfigured apron cannot exhaust memory. |
| [x] | Shard mesh networking — `ShardMesh.h` defines the `IShardMesh` abstract fabric with `Start`, `Stop`, `RegisterPeer`, `UnregisterPeer`, `Send`, `SetInboundHandler`, and `SetPeerStateHandler`; delivery is in-order per peer and callbacks are serialised per peer so consumers do not have to think about concurrent dispatch; the interface guarantees neither exactly-once nor partition tolerance because different transports (gRPC, raw TCP, NATS, shared-memory fast path for co-located zones) pick different trade-offs, and per-peer outbound queues are capped so a stalled link reports `BackpressureFull` rather than growing without bound. |

---

## 7. Concurrency (oneTBB)

The concurrency layer owns the thread pool, the lock-free primitives,
and the scheduling machinery. Every subsystem that wants to run work
off the main thread goes through these interfaces — rolling your own
`std::thread` in gameplay code is a code-review block.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | oneTBB chosen as the worker-pool backend. |
| [x] | Job system framework — `Engine/Core/Threading/JobSystem`. |
| [x] | `SpinLock` — `Engine/Core/Threading/SpinLock`. |
| [x] | `std::shared_mutex` adopted wherever a reader / writer pattern applies. |
| [x] | Task graph system for dependency-aware job scheduling — `TaskGraph.h` / `.cpp` defines `NodeHandle`, `AddNode`, `AddDependency`, and `Execute`; the implementation runs Kahn's topological sort to detect cycles (logging the offending nodes by name), computes per-node depth via longest path, groups nodes into waves, and schedules each wave in parallel through `JobSystem` with a wait barrier at the end of each wave; the graph holds up to 4096 nodes and is reusable across frames via `Reset`. |
| [x] | Parallel simulation chunks — ECS batch processing — `ParallelSystemExecutor.h` / `.cpp` lets a `WorldState` opt into parallel ticks by declaring which ECS systems may run concurrently; dependencies are declared explicitly (`AddDependency(pred, succ)`) rather than inferred from component-access annotations, so the declaration is reviewable and the underlying `TaskGraph` catches cycles at runtime; the executor keeps its nodes across frames so the graph's node table does not churn. |
| [x] | Lock-free structures — `AtomicCounter.h` provides stats counters with `relaxed` fetch-add semantics for hot-path telemetry. |
| [x] | False-sharing prevention — `CacheLine.h` defines `kCacheLineSize`, `SAGA_CACHE_ALIGNED`, and a `CacheLinePad<T>` wrapper so hot structures can pad themselves onto their own cache lines. |
| [ ] | Work-stealing scheduler integration. |

---

## 8. Math (GLM)

Math underlies everything: rendering, physics, replication, deterministic
simulation. GLM is the engine's numerical backend, but the engine's
public headers never expose GLM types; instead, every public header
uses the engine's own `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Transform`, and `Mat4` types,
and a single bridge header is the only place where `<glm/*>` is
allowed. This keeps GLM a concrete, replaceable dependency rather than
a viral include.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | GLM chosen as the numerical backend. |
| [x] | Engine math wrappers — `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Transform` are GLM-free value types. |
| [x] | Math constants — `kPi`, `kEpsilon`, `kDegToRad` live in `MathConstants.h`. |
| [x] | Scalar helpers — `Clamp`, `Lerp`, `SmoothStep`, `ApproxEqual`, `LerpAngle` live in `MathScalar.h`. |
| [x] | SIMD optimisation layer — `MathSimd.h` covers SSE, AVX2, NEON, and a scalar fallback. |
| [x] | Deterministic math phase 1 — `DeterministicMath.h` / `.cpp` ship polynomial `Sin` / `Cos` / `Atan2`, Q16.16 fixed-point primitives, and an `fesetround` lock so the floating-point rounding mode cannot drift out from under the sim. |
| [x] | Deterministic math phase 2 — `DeterministicVectors.h` ships `FixedVec3` and `FixedQuat` with integer-only arithmetic (see section 4 for the rationale); the Hamilton product widens to `int64_t` before the `>> 16` shift so two near-range inputs cannot wrap, and `FromFloat` / `ToFloat` are the only places where a `float` can enter or leave a fixed-point value. |
| [x] | `Mat4` type and TRS matrix helpers — `Mat4.h` / `.cpp` is column-major, uses right-handed zero-to-one projection, computes the inverse via cofactor, and exposes a `FromTransform` fast path. |
| [x] | `MathGLMBridge` — `MathGLMBridge.h` / `.cpp` is the single opt-in header that includes `<glm/*>`; it defines `ToGlm` / `FromGlm` for `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Mat4`, and `Transform`, with explicit `wxyz` ↔ `xyzw` swaps, layout `static_assert`s so a silent GLM upgrade cannot misalign fields, and an out-of-line `Transform` fast path that inlines the quaternion-to-matrix conversion rather than going through GLM twice; every ECS, Replication, Client, and Networking header is forbidden from including this file and that rule is documented on the header itself. |

---

## 9. Data Layer

The data layer owns persistent state (characters, inventory, accounts)
and hot state (session cache, presence, rate limits). The two halves
have very different durability requirements and very different
access patterns, so they get separate backends and separate
interfaces.

### PostgreSQL (persistent data)

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `PostgreSQLImpl` stub — `Backends/Database`. |
| [ ] | Connection pool implementation. |
| [ ] | Asynchronous query system. |
| [ ] | Migration system with schema versioning. |
| [ ] | Transaction handling — ACID guarantees. |
| [ ] | Account, character, and inventory schemas. |

### Redis (hot state)

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `RedisImpl` stub — `Backends/Database`. |
| [ ] | Session cache implementation. |
| [ ] | Rate-limit system. |
| [ ] | Pub / Sub event system. |
| [ ] | Presence tracking (online, offline, zone-resident). |

---

## 10. Logging (spdlog)

Logging is the first tool we reach for when something breaks in
production. The engine exposes a small abstract interface for log
writes; spdlog is a backend sink behind that interface rather than a
dependency of the engine proper. That separation means the engine can
be built without spdlog on platforms where it is inconvenient, and it
prevents spdlog's transitive includes from leaking into every compile
unit.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Engine log abstraction — `SagaEngine/Core/Log/Log`. |
| [x] | Log macro system — `LOG_INFO`, `LOG_WARN`, `LOG_ERROR`, `LOG_DEBUG`. |
| [x] | Thread-safe logging through the tag system. |
| [ ] | spdlog backend integration (Saga log → spdlog sink). |
| [x] | Asynchronous logging mode — `AsyncLogQueue.h` / `.cpp` implements a fixed-capacity single-producer / single-consumer lock-free ring that hands formatted messages to a dedicated writer thread; the producer never blocks (a full ring drops the line and increments a visible `droppedCount` counter so operators know to size the ring up), capacity is enforced to be a power of two so the wrap is a bitmask and not a modulo, and `DrainTo` accepts a per-call cap so the writer cannot monopolise disk bandwidth during a burst. |
| [x] | Log categories — `LogCategories.h` defines eighteen canonical tags and the matching `LOG_CAT_*` macros. |
| [x] | Crash dump and stack trace integration — `CrashHandler.h` / `.cpp` installs async-signal-safe handlers for `SIGSEGV`, `SIGILL`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGABRT`, and `SIGBUS` on POSIX (and exposes the hook for `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` on Windows); every byte written from inside the handler goes through async-signal-safe primitives (no `malloc`, no `printf`, no locks), a static BSS buffer holds the dump text, and a one-shot re-entrancy guard aborts immediately on a crash-inside-the-crash-handler; a global `FrameTagProbe` lets the simulation thread publish the current tick counter and subsystem name so the dump includes the engine's idea of what it was doing when it died; the handler re-raises the signal after writing so the kernel still produces a core file and the parent init observes a real exit status. |
| [x] | Log rotation and file output — `LogRotation.h` / `.cpp` implements `LogRotationSink` with size-triggered rotation at 64 MiB, timestamp-suffixed backup files, a `PruneBackups` routine that keeps the last N backups sorted by modification time, a `ForceRotate` entry point for `SIGHUP`, mutex-guarded `fopen` / `fwrite` so concurrent writes can't interleave, and automatic creation of the logs directory on first open. |

---

## 11. Testing

Testing is split into example-based coverage (GoogleTest) and
property-based coverage (RapidCheck). Example tests catch regressions;
property tests catch the invariants we think we have but have not
written down. Both are run in CI.

### GoogleTest

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Unit test framework — ECS, input, networking, simulation. |
| [x] | Integration tests — client / server, persistence, replication. |
| [x] | Stress tests — concurrent entity, network load. |
| [x] | Replication round-trip tests — `ReplicationRoundTripTest.h/.cpp`: delta encode/decode, full snapshot serialisation, CRC32 integrity, schema forward-compatibility. |
| [x] | `DeltaSnapshot` serialisation invariant tests — entity count verification, component structure validation, bounds check coverage. |
| [x] | `WorldSnapshot` CRC32 integrity tests — corruption detection, payload truncation handling. |
| [x] | Chaos tests — `ChaosTest.h/.cpp`: packet reorder, random drop, latency spike, byte corruption, gap storm, combined mode. |
| [x] | Determinism guard tests — `DeterminismGuardTest.h/.cpp`: granular hash consistency, apply order independence, float canonicalisation, entity iteration determinism. |
| [x] | Soak tests — `SoakTest.h/.cpp`: normal operation (1M ticks), intermittent desync, high churn, bandwidth pressure. |
| [x] | Adversarial model tests — `AdversarialModelTest.h/.cpp`: CPU starvation, gap storm, replay attack, sequence wrap-around, decode bomb. |
| [x] | Performance budget tests — `PerformanceBudgetTest.h/.cpp`: max apply time per tick, worst-case entity burst, per-component deserialize budget, cold cache cost. |
| [x] | Schema migration tests — `SchemaMigrationTest.h/.cpp`: major mismatch, minor forward/backward compatibility, patch negotiation, component type skipping. |
| [ ] | `ConnectionManager` concurrency tests. |
| [ ] | `ShardManager` routing correctness tests. |
| [ ] | `ZoneServer` lifecycle integration test. |

### RapidCheck

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Serialisation invariants — `serialize(deserialize(x)) == x` covered by round-trip and fuzz tests. |
| [x] | Determinism tests — the same input produces the same output across runs; `DeterminismGuardTest` verifies hash consistency and apply order invariance. |
| [x] | Replication correctness — dirty-tracking consistency covered by chaos tests and soak tests. |
| [ ] | `ComponentDirtyMask` bit-operation properties. |

---

## 12. SCRIPTING RUNTIME (C# / .NET 8)

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | CoreCLR host integration — runtime init, shutdown, error propagation, and deterministic teardown.                                    |
| [ ]    | Collectible `AssemblyLoadContext` lifecycle — per-package load, unload, dependency resolution, and stale-reference detection.        |
| [ ]    | Native → Managed bridge — engine events, tick callbacks, and object handles exposed to C#.                                           |
| [ ]    | Managed → Native bridge — generated, type-safe calls with no reflection on hot paths.                                                |
| [ ]    | Canonical gameplay API — `IEntity`, `IWorld`, `IComponent`, `IQuery`, and `ISystem`.                                                 |
| [ ]    | Safe marshaling layer — blittable structs, strings, spans, arrays, handles, and ownership rules.                                     |
| [ ]    | Thread-safe call boundary — async-safe dispatch between engine threads and script threads.                                           |
| [ ]    | Cooperative execution budget — per-tick script time budget, watchdog, cancellation, and safe fallback.                               |
| [ ]    | Script hot reload — supported edit sets reload in place; unsupported edits fall back to rebuild / restart.                           |
| [ ]    | Script package format — manifests, dependency resolution, versioning, and compatibility checks.                                      |
| [ ]    | Script diagnostics — compile errors, runtime exceptions, stack traces, source maps, and profiling markers.                           |
| [ ]    | Deterministic test harness — repeatable script replay under fixed inputs and fixed tick order.                                       |
| [ ]    | Sandbox worker mode — out-of-process isolation for untrusted scripts, with file / network restrictions and crash containment.        |
| [ ]    | Script SDK — library authors can register gameplay APIs, script APIs, and generated bindings through a documented extension surface. |

## 12.1 CANONICAL IR / COMPILATION PIPELINE

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | Canonical IR definition — one intermediate representation shared by block authoring and text authoring.         |
| [ ]    | Block-to-IR compiler — graph nodes, typed pins, collapse groups, and macro expansion lower into IR.             |
| [ ]    | C# subset parser — supported gameplay syntax parses into the same IR.                                           |
| [ ]    | IR-to-runtime compiler — IR lowers into compiled script methods, bytecode, or another optimized runtime form.   |
| [ ]    | Round-trip policy — supported constructs preserve meaning across block view and text view.                      |
| [ ]    | Unsupported syntax policy — unsupported C# features fail clearly instead of silently drifting.                  |
| [ ]    | Metadata preservation — comments, symbols, and user-facing labels survive supported round trips where feasible. |
| [ ]    | Incremental compilation — dirty-region rebuild for both blocks and text.                                        |
| [ ]    | Background compile workers — parse, validate, and regenerate without blocking editor input.                     |
| [ ]    | Generated node metadata — source generators emit node descriptors, docs, and validation hooks.                  |

## 12.2 PERFORMANCE MODEL AND RUNTIME BOUNDARIES

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | Authoring/runtime separation — blocks and C# are editor-facing representations, not runtime interpreters.                              |
| [ ]    | Runtime execution rule — gameplay runs from compiled output, never from node-by-node graph interpretation on the main simulation path. |
| [ ]    | Edit-time sync cost containment — block movement, parse updates, and C# regeneration happen off the hot path.                          |
| [ ]    | Hot reload debounce — changes batch before rebuild to avoid thrashing on every keystroke.                                              |
| [ ]    | Partial recompilation — only changed compilation units regenerate when possible.                                                       |
| [ ]    | Reflection avoidance — runtime invocation uses generated bindings, cached delegates, or direct dispatch.                               |
| [ ]    | Allocation control — pooled objects, stack-friendly value types, and native arena-style allocation where appropriate.                  |
| [ ]    | Hot-path separation — combat, netcode, replication, pathfinding, and tight AI loops stay native or otherwise optimized.                |
| [ ]    | Runtime budget enforcement — script work is capped per tick and can yield or be suspended safely.                                      |
| [ ]    | Editor-only overhead acceptance — extra cost is allowed in the editor, not in shipped simulation.                                      |

## 13. VISUAL AUTHORING / EDITOR SHELL

> UI framework: **Qt** (QMainWindow, QDockWidget, QWidget, QDialog).

## 14. EXTENSIONS & PACKAGE SDK

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | Package manifest schema — explicit package identity, dependencies, compatibility range, and load order.                  |
| [ ]    | Extension discovery — runtime and editor can enumerate installed packages without hard-coded registration.               |
| [ ]    | Node registration API — third-party packages can add block nodes, categories, tooltips, and validation metadata.         |
| [ ]    | Script library API — packages can expose gameplay helpers, shared types, and generated bindings.                         |
| [ ]    | Editor tool API — packages can add panels, inspectors, menus, shortcuts, and graph tools.                                |
| [ ]    | Version compatibility rules — package load fails fast on incompatible engine or scripting ABI versions.                  |
| [ ]    | Isolation and unload rules — packages can be unloaded cleanly when no managed references remain.                         |
| [ ]    | Sample packages — reference packages for gameplay scripts, block nodes, editor tools, and asset pipeline extensions.     |
| [ ]    | Package signing / trust model — trusted packages, local packages, and untrusted packages follow different load policies. |

## 15. DEBUGGING, PROFILING, AND VALIDATION

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | Script profiler — per-method and per-node timing for C# and block-authored gameplay.                             |
| [ ]    | Graph debugger — node-level breakpoints, watch values, and execution tracing.                                    |
| [ ]    | Runtime trace capture — inputs, replication, script events, and simulation state snapshots.                      |
| [ ]    | State diff tooling — compare world state, snapshot state, and replay state across runs.                          |
| [ ]    | Failure reproduction runner — load a captured scenario and replay it locally or in CI.                           |

## 16. SECURITY AND ISOLATION POLICY

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ]    | Trusted in-process mode — first-party packages and trusted gameplay scripts may run inside the main process.    |
| [ ]    | Untrusted out-of-process mode — sandboxed scripts run in separate worker processes with restricted access.      |
| [ ]    | Permission policy — file, network, reflection, and native access are controlled by package trust level.         |
| [ ]    | Failure containment — script crashes, deadlocks, and runaway allocations do not take down the editor or server. |
| [ ]    | Security boundary documentation — clear rules for what the engine does and does not guarantee.                  |
| [ ]    | Host fallback policy — unsupported or dangerous script features fail into safe fallback paths.                  |

## 17. DOCUMENTATION AND SAMPLE CONTENT

## 13. Client (SDL)

The client uses SDL for its window, input, and platform abstraction.
Gameplay runs a predicted local simulation that the server continually
reconciles; the interpolation and reconciliation machinery listed here
is what makes that prediction feel tight without letting it drift away
from the authoritative state.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | `SDLWindow` and `SDLPlatformFactory`. |
| [x] | Input system — keyboard, mouse, gamepad. |
| [x] | Input action mapping. |
| [x] | Client prediction framework. |
| [x] | Interpolation system for smoothing remote entity positions. |
| [x] | Prediction reconciliation — `ReconciliationBuffer.h` is a templated ring buffer that records a predicted state per input sequence; `AcknowledgeAndReconcile` prunes acknowledged history, compares the squared position error against a configurable threshold, rewinds to the authoritative state, and replays every still-pending input through a caller-supplied functor, updating the ring in place so the next frame predicts from the corrected baseline. |
| [x] | Input command buffer — `InputCommandBuffer.h` / `.cpp` with thread-safe push/peek/mark-sent/acknowledge semantics; **fixed `AckUpTo` to also clear pending commands for fast-path reconnect scenarios** (test `AckUpToAlsoClearsPending` now passes). |
| [x] | Client-side replication apply pipeline — deterministic, atomic, authority-aware `DeltaSnapshot` / `WorldSnapshot` to ECS pipeline with: six-state replication state machine, transactional `PatchJournal` (sort-validate-commit), RTT-aware sliding sequence window, exploit-resistant wire decoders, schema version negotiation, canonical world hash, time-budget guards, authority model (`ServerOwned` / `ClientPredicted` / `ClientOnly`), deterministic scheduler, granular hash debugging, adaptive interest management, telemetry with alert system, adversarial rate limiting, snapshot size enforcement, tick drift correction, schema migration policy, catastrophic recovery ladder, rollback snapshot cache, replication memory tracker, fuzz and soak test harness; files: `SnapshotApplyPipeline.h/.cpp`, `ReplicationStateMachine.h/.cpp`, `DeltaSnapshotWire.h/.cpp`, `WorldSnapshotWire.h/.cpp`, `PatchJournal.h/.cpp`, `EcsSnapshotApply.h/.cpp`, `PacketDemux.h/.cpp`, `ReplicationTelemetry.h/.cpp`, `RollbackSnapshotCache.h/.cpp`, `DeterminismVerifier.h/.cpp`, `InterestManagement.h/.cpp`, `ReplicationScheduler.h/.cpp`, `GranularWorldHash.h/.cpp`, `AdaptiveInterestManager.h/.cpp`, `TelemetryAlertSystem.h/.cpp`, `RateLimitGuard.h/.cpp`, `ReplicationMemoryTracker.h/.cpp`, `SnapshotSizeGuard.h/.cpp`, `TickDriftCorrector.h/.cpp`, `SchemaMigrationPolicy.h/.cpp`, `CatastrophicRecoveryManager.h/.cpp`. |
| [ ] | Render loop — RHI and `FrameGraph` pipeline. |

---

## 14. ECS

The ECS is the engine's data model. Every piece of gameplay state
lives in a component; every behaviour lives in a system; nothing
touches the component storage directly. This section is short because
the ECS was one of the first subsystems to stabilise.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Entity, component, archetype, query, system. |
| [x] | `ComponentRegistry` with explicit ID assignment (`Register<T>(id, name)`) — no auto-increment, deterministic across binaries. |
| [x] | `ComponentSerializerRegistry` with explicit deterministic ID assignment — `Register<T>(id, name, ser, deser, size)` replaces the old auto-increment `RegisterComponent`; collisions throw `std::logic_error`; `Reset()` for test teardown. |
| [x] | Archetype migration — runtime component add / remove. |
| [x] | Parallel system execution — `ParallelSystemExecutor.h` (see section 7) wraps `TaskGraph` so a `WorldState` can opt into parallel ticks with explicit dependency declarations. |
| [x] | Event-driven component observers. |

---

## 15. Render Pipeline

The render pipeline is the frontend to everything visual. The RHI
abstracts the underlying graphics API (Diligent today, Vulkan / D3D12
direct later) and the render graph compiles a frame's work into a
linear command stream the RHI can execute. Materials are data-only
descriptions that both the renderer and the asset pipeline agree on.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | RHI interface (`IRHI`) with the Diligent backend. |
| [x] | `RenderGraph` and compilation. |
| [x] | `GBufferPass`, `LightingPass`. |
| [x] | `CommandBuffer` and `CommandRecorder`. |
| [x] | Material system — `Render/Materials/Material.h` defines the data-only material description shared by the renderer and the asset pipeline; `MaterialAsset` is the on-disk form (string-addressable shader template name, asset-id texture references, name / value parameter pairs); `MaterialRuntime` is the post-resolve form the renderer consumes (interned `ShaderTemplateHandle`, resolved `TextureHandle`s, flat fixed-size parameter arrays) so the draw submission path is copy-then-bind without any map lookups; the header is deliberately free of GLM and of any math dependency (it defines a local `MaterialVec4` instead) so it does not pull the math library into every translation unit that touches a draw call; a `MakeErrorMaterial` helper produces a neon-pink fallback that is immediately visible when an asset fails to resolve. |
| [x] | Mesh asset descriptor — `Render/Materials/MeshAsset.h` defines the CPU-side, GLM-free static mesh description (interleaved `MeshVertex`, per-submesh material id, up to four LODs with streaming hints, `MeshAabb` bounding volume) so the renderer, physics, and streaming manager can all read the same type without pulling the math or RHI headers in; hard caps (`kMaxMeshVerticesPerLod`, `kMaxMeshIndicesPerLod`) turn pathological imports into visible failures. |
| [x] | Shadow pass descriptors — `Render/RenderPasses/ShadowMap.h` defines the declarative shadow pass input: `ShadowAtlasConfig`, `ShadowQualityBudget`, `DirectionalCascadeConfig` (four-cascade default with a `cascadeLambda` practical-split weight and per-cascade bias arrays), `ShadowPassDescriptor` with per-slot atlas rects, view-projection matrices, and a `needsRedraw` gate so static-light cascades are skipped; compile-time `kMaxDirectionalCascades` and `kMaxShadowCastersPerFrame` bound the scheduling graph. |
| [x] | Post-process graph descriptors — `Render/RenderPasses/PostProcessGraph.h` defines the declarative post-process pipeline (tonemap, bloom, motion blur, DoF, etc.) that the render graph consumes. |
| [ ] | Mesh runtime upload pipeline — `MeshAsset` → RHI vertex / index buffers, per-LOD GPU residency, streaming manager integration. |
| [ ] | Shadow atlas allocator + cascade split implementation (consumes `ShadowPassDescriptor` and `DirectionalCascadeConfig`). |
| [ ] | Post-processing runtime — the actual shaders, temporary targets, and frame-graph wiring for tonemap / bloom / motion blur / DoF. |
| [ ] | `GBufferPass.h` / `LightingPass.h` — currently empty descriptor headers; needs `GBufferBinding`, `LightingUniforms`, and the render-graph consumer contract. |

---

## 15.5. World Kernel

The World Kernel is the server-side simulation core that replaces the
old ZoneServer.  It owns dynamic simulation cells (SimCells),
multi-rate domain scheduling, event-sourced state via an append-only
EventStream, context-based interest management via the RelevanceGraph,
and the WorldNode process that ties everything together.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | SimCell identity and footprint — `SimCellId` (world-coord + generation), `SimCellFootprint` (AABB with `ContainsPoint` / `DistanceSqToPoint`), and `CoordFromWorld` / `DistanceSqCoordToWorldPoint` helpers. |

| [x] | SimCell entity management — `AddEntity`, `RemoveEntity`, `HasEntity`, `Entities()`, and `EntityCount()` with automatic event logging. |
| [x] | SimCell domain registration — `RegisterDomains` / `UnregisterDomains` with `SimDomainMask` bitmask for Combat, Movement, Economy, Politics, Ecology, Narrative. |
| [x] | SimCell metrics and thresholds — `SimCellMetrics` (entity/player/NPC count, CPU load, memory), `SimCellThresholds` (max/min entities, player limits, merge grace period), and `UpdateMetrics()` with automatic low-state tracking. |
| [x] | SimCell split/merge decision logic — `ShouldSplit()` (entity count or player count exceeds threshold) and `ShouldMerge()` (entity count below minimum for grace period). |
| [x] | SimCell split/merge execution — `ExecuteSplit()` returns two child cell IDs with entity partition, `ExecuteMergeInto()` transfers all entities to target cell and sets source to Dormant. |
| [x] | SimCell event log — `AppendEvent()`, `DrainEvents()`, and `SimCellEvent` type with timestamp, world tick, entity reference, and scalar payload. |
| [x] | DomainScheduler multi-rate ticking — `RegisterDomain`, `RegisterCell`, `Tick()` returns `outFiringDomains` with accumulator-based fractional tick scheduling (60 Hz Combat, 20 Hz Movement, 1 Hz Economy, event-driven Politics/Ecology/Narrative). |
| [x] | DomainScheduler cell management — per-domain cell registry with `RegisterCell`, `UnregisterCell`, `UnregisterCellAll`, and `GetDomainCells()` for WorldNode dispatch. |
| [x] | DomainScheduler stats — `DomainStats` with `totalTicksFired`, `lastFireWorldTick`, and `subTickAccumulator` for diagnostic overlay. |
| [x] | EventStream append-only log — `Append()`, `AppendBatch()` with auto-sequencing, `ReplayFromStart`, `ReplayFromSnapshot`, `ReplayRange`, `GetEventsAfter`, and `GetEvent()` by sequence. |
| [x] | EventStream disk persistence — `Open()` (Windows HANDLE / POSIX FILE*), `Close()`, `FlushPending()` (64 KiB buffer with fsync), `LoadFromFile()` (binary format parse), `SaveSnapshot()` / `LoadLatestSnapshot()` (separate snapshot file), and `SerializeEvent()` / `DeserializeEvent()` (40-byte header + variable payload). |
| [x] | EventStream snapshot support — `WorldSnapshot` with `baseSequence`, `worldTick`, `timestampUs`, and `stateData` blob; `TakeSnapshot()` and `LatestSnapshot()` for periodic checkpointing. |
| [x] | RelevanceGraph directed interest — `RelevanceEdge` (target, weight, reason, context), `SetEdge` / `RemoveSource` / `RemoveTarget`, adjacency list with `TotalEdges()` and `SourceCount()`. |
| [x] | RelevanceGraph rule system — `RelevanceRule` with `computeWeight` functor, `AddRule` / `ClearRules`, eight reason types (Spatial, CombatTarget, RaidMember, GuildRelation, Economy, Narrative, GlobalInterest, Custom). |
| [x] | RelevanceGraph rebuild — `Rebuild()` evaluates all rules for all entity pairs (O(N²)), `IncrementalUpdate()` for single-entity changes, `SetEntityList()` for WorldNode integration. |
| [x] | RelevanceGraph queries — `Query(source, minWeight)` returns sorted `RelevanceResult` list (max weight across reasons), `GetWeight(source, target)`, and `GetEdgesFrom(source)`. |
| [x] | WorldNode lifecycle — `Init()` (registers 6 default domains), `Tick()` (6-phase pipeline: DrainInput → StepSimulation → FireDomains → UpdateRelevance → ReplicateToClients → FlushEvents), `Shutdown()`. |
| [x] | WorldNode cell management — `GetOrCreateCell` (coord-packed hash map), `GetCell`, `RemoveCell`, `Cells()`, with automatic event logging and scheduler registration. |
| [x] | WorldNode entity management — `SpawnEntity`, `DespawnEntity`, `MoveEntity` (cross-cell transfer), `GetEntityCell`, with entity→cell coord mapping for O(1) lookup. |
| [x] | WorldNode client sessions — `AddClientSession`, `RemoveClientSession`, `GetClientSession`, `ClientSession` struct with `controlledEntity`, `lastAckedTick`, `lastSeenEventSeq`, `wantsFullSnapshot`, `currentCell`. |
| [x] | WorldNode domain dispatch — `RegisterDomain` with callback registration, `SetDomainDispatcher` (called when domains fire), `FireDomains()` iterates scheduler output and dispatches per-cell tick with subTick accumulator. |
| [x] | WorldNode relevance integration — `UpdateRelevance()` collects all entities, calls `SetEntityList()` and `Rebuild()` on the graph, with query counter tracking. |
| [x] | WorldNode replication — `ReplicateToClient()` sends events after client's `lastSeenEventSeq`, tracks `snapshotsSent` / `deltasSent`, and clears `wantsFullSnapshot` flag after first send. |
| [x] | WorldNode event flushing — `FlushEvents()` drains per-cell event logs to the global EventStream, converting `SimCellEvent` to `WorldEvent` with cell ID and world tick. |
| [ ] | WorldNode input drain — `DrainInput()` stub; needs client session input queue integration. |
| [ ] | WorldNode simulation step — `StepSimulation()` stub; needs ECS system tick integration. |
| [ ] | WorldNode snapshot serialization — `ReplicateToClient()` TODO: actual snapshot/delta encode for client delivery. |
| [ ] | SimCell spatial split — `ExecuteSplit()` currently does round-robin partition; needs position-based entity partition using ECS transform query. |
| [ ] | WorldNode cell migration — `Migrating` state defined but no cross-node transfer logic yet. |

## 16. Resources and Asset Streaming

An MMO's world is larger than the client's RAM.  Only a thin slice of
assets is resident at any instant; the resources subsystem decides
which mesh, texture, shader, or audio clip should come in next, which
one should be evicted, and how to pace disk I/O so the frame rate
does not hitch while a zone loads.  The data contract lives in
`StreamingRequest.h`; this section tracks the orchestrator that
consumes those requests and the pluggable source backends that fulfil
them.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Streaming request data contract — `StreamingRequest.h` defines `AssetId`, `AssetKind`, `StreamingPriority`, the `StreamingRequest` POD, the `StreamingResultPayload`, the `StreamingRequestHandle` future (atomic status + cooperative `Cancel` + move-once payload), and hard caps (`kMaxStreamingPayloadBytes`, `kMaxStreamingQueueDepth`) so a runaway producer cannot flood the queue. |
| [x] | Pluggable asset source interface — `IAssetSource.h` defines `AssetLoadResult` and the one-method contract `LoadBlocking(const StreamingRequest&, const StreamingRequestHandle&) → AssetLoadResult`; the streaming manager never `fopen`s on its own so a disk source, a package-file source, and a network CDN source all drop in behind the same interface; optional `Prefetch` and `DebugName` hooks are provided as no-op defaults so trivial backends only have to override `LoadBlocking`. |
| [x] | Streaming manager orchestrator — `StreamingManager.h` / `.cpp` owns the priority queue, the worker thread pool, and the handle publishing; requests are sorted by `(priority, arrivalSeq)` so equal-priority requests stay FIFO; worker count is clamped to 1..64 and defaults to four; cancelled requests are dropped at dispatch time; shutdown is two-phase (flag → wake → join → fail every still-pending handle with `StreamingStatus::ShuttingDown`); bounded queue capacity rejects with `StreamingStatus::SourceError` when a runaway producer floods the manager; all completion callbacks fire with the mutex released so a re-entrant callback cannot deadlock against `Submit`; source exceptions are swallowed into `StreamingStatus::InternalError` so a rogue backend cannot kill a worker thread. |
| [x] | Decoded asset cache — `ResourceManager.h` / `.cpp` keeps a reference-counted residency map keyed by `AssetId`, routes cache misses through the streaming manager, and evicts LRU entries once total bytes exceed a budget; consumers borrow `ResidencyHandle` refs (full rule-of-five) instead of owning decoded bytes directly, and a weak-ptr completion callback keeps stale streaming results from resurrecting evicted entries. |
| [x] | Mesh importer — `Resources/Formats/GltfMeshImporter.h` / `.cpp` reads `.gltf` / `.glb` (with a hand-rolled JSON parser so the importer carries no external dep) and produces a `Render::MeshAsset`; LOD population from meshopt-simplified copies remains a follow-up but the cold path is in place. |
| [x] | Texture importer — `Resources/Formats/TextureImporter.h` / `.cpp` reads DDS and KTX2 into a `TextureAsset` with all block-compressed formats (BC1–BC7, ASTC 4×4 / 6×6 / 8×8) covered; byte-offset reads avoid struct-packing traps and the mip chain is produced without a second copy. |
| [x] | Asset registry / content manifest — `Resources/AssetRegistry.h` / `.cpp` loads a cooked JSON manifest (hand-rolled parser, no external JSON dep) into a stable `AssetId → AssetRegistryEntry` map with `Find`, `FindByKind`, and `GetPrefetchCandidates` lookups; `AssetFlags` surfaces per-entry hints (`kCritical`, `kApronDependency`, `kCooked`, `kEditorOnly`, `kPrefetch`) the streaming orchestrator consumes. |
| [x] | Streaming budget configuration — `Resources/StreamingBudget.h` / `.cpp` ships per-platform profiles (`DesktopHighEnd`, `DesktopMidRange`, `ConsoleNextGen`, `MobileHigh`, `MobileLow`) with three independent subsystem budgets (raw, decoded mesh, decoded texture), soft / hard limits for each, a `Pressure` ratio that takes the max of the three subsystem pressures, and a `WouldExceedHardLimit` pre-acquisition gate so the streamer can reject new requests before they allocate. |
| [x] | Typed streaming facades — `Resources/AssetTypes/MeshStreamer.h` / `.cpp` and `TextureStreamer.h` / `.cpp` sit on top of `ResourceManager` and turn raw bytes into decoded `Render::MeshAsset` / `TextureAsset` values; each streamer owns a mutex-guarded decoded cache with its own byte budget so a zone full of 4K textures cannot starve the mesh cache, and the double-check pattern after a decode keeps two worker threads from racing on the same import. |
| [x] | File asset source — `Resources/FileAssetSource.h` / `.cpp` implements `IAssetSource` with a configurable `PathResolverFn`, 64 KiB chunked reads, and cooperative cancellation polling through `StreamingRequestHandle::CancelRequested`; it is the default backend for development builds and for any deployment that streams from a local content package. |

## 17. Gaps and Scaffolding Debt

Subsystems whose directories exist but whose headers are currently
empty.  Tracked here so they do not rot silently.

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [ ] | `Core/Modules/IModule.h`, `ModuleManager.h`, `ModuleRegistry.h` — hot-pluggable DLL / shared-object module system, currently empty files. |
| [ ] | `Core/Profiling/ProfilerMacros.h` — empty; needs the `SAGA_PROFILE_SCOPE` zero-cost macro that wraps the existing `Profiler.h` API. |
| [ ] | `Physics/PhysicsEngine.h` — header is empty even though `SagaPhysicsEngine.cpp` references it; needs the PhysX-backed collision / kinematics surface. |
| [ ] | `Audio/` — no public headers; `SagaAudioEngine.cpp` compiles against an internal surface that should be promoted to `Engine/include/SagaEngine/Audio/`. |
| [x] | `World/Partition/Cell.h` / `.cpp` — the atomic streaming unit, with `CellCoord` (injective `PackCellCoord` for hash-table keys), a `CellFootprint` AABB, a `CellState` streaming-lifecycle enum (`Dormant → Prefetching → Loaded → Draining`), a `CellAssetRef` pair so the loader can call `ResourceManager::Acquire` with the right typed `AssetKind` without a registry round-trip, and `CellCoordFromWorld` / `DistanceSqToFootprint` helpers that use `floor` semantics so the grid does not split on the sign boundary. |
| [x] | `World/Partition/Boundary.h` / `.cpp` — apron descriptor with inner / outer Chebyshev rings, per-ring streaming priorities, a `drainGraceTicks` hysteresis window that stops the loader from thrashing when the player walks along a seam, a `BoundaryRing` classification the loader drives with a single switch, and a `PriorityForRing` mapping so the loader and diagnostics panel agree on the same numbers. |
| [x] | `World/Partition/Zone.h` / `.cpp` — rectangular grid container keyed by `ZoneId`; `Configure` lays out the cells eagerly with footprints and `Dormant` state, `FindCell` is an O(1) row-major lookup, `WorldToCell` accounts for the zone origin offset, and `ContainsCoord` is the bounds check every cross-zone handshake uses to decide which process owns the destination cell. |
| [x] | `World/Streaming/LODManager.h` / `.cpp` — distance + budget-pressure LOD selector that emits a `[0, kMaxLodIndex]` index matching the `Render::MeshAsset` LOD layout; pinned entities bypass the distance test but still honour the `residencyFloor` (the renderer cannot draw with bytes that are not in memory), and a configurable `pressureBiasDeadZone` stops the manager from flickering between LODs when pressure hovers near the soft limit. |
| [x] | `World/Streaming/ResourceStream.h` / `.cpp` — world-level streaming orchestrator that ties `Zone`, `Boundary`, `LODManager`, `ResourceManager`, and `StreamingBudget` together; `Tick(focalX, focalZ, currentTick)` walks the outer-radius square around the focal cell, promotes unknown cells to `Prefetching`, polls residency handles to advance `Prefetching → Loaded`, demotes untouched cells to `Draining`, evicts once the grace window elapses, and returns a `ResourceStreamTickStats` record the diagnostics overlay can display; the tracked-cell map is capped by `maxTrackedCells` so a misconfigured zone cannot grow the table without bound. |
| [ ] | `Core/Events/EventBus.h` — code exists but does not follow `CodingStandards.md` (missing `/// @file` header, `_mutex` snake_case, no section dividers); needs a style pass. |
| [ ] | `Networking/Replication/RPC.h` — stub macro file with a TODO `/* Serialize args and send via NetworkTransport */`; needs a real RPC codec and dispatch table. |
| [ ] | `Networking/Client/Prediction.h` — empty server-side header for client-prediction bookkeeping; needs a type that mirrors the engine-side `ClientPrediction.h`. |
| [ ] | Math unit tests — no GoogleTest coverage for `Vec3`, `Quat`, `Mat4`, `Transform`, `DeterministicMath`, `DeterministicVectors`, or `MathGLMBridge` round-trips. |
| [ ] | Resources unit tests — streaming manager cancellation semantics, priority ordering, queue-full backpressure. |
| [ ] | Render unit tests — material / mesh asset descriptor invariants, shadow cascade split maths.

## 18. Reliability, Observability, and Validation

This section covers the cross-cutting reliability stack that spans engine code,
developer tools, and CI infrastructure. It is not a single subsystem and it is
not a test folder. Engine code emits structured signals and lightweight
assertions; tools consume those signals to reproduce failures; CI gates enforce
that regressions never merge.

The goal is to catch memory leaks, resource leaks, state corruption, determinism
drift, replication bugs, and unsafe failure modes before they reach production.
The engine should stay cheap in the hot path; heavier inspection, replay
analysis, and chaos orchestration belong outside the runtime.

| [ ] | Unified runtime assertion and invariant framework for core subsystems. |
| [ ] | Leak markers for engine-owned allocations, handles, and streaming resources. |
| [ ] | Replay-friendly trace points for simulation, replication, and input flow. |

### 18.2 Validation Tools

| Status | Item |
|--------|------|
| [x] | Network chaos coverage for drop, reorder, latency, corruption, and gap storms. |
| [x] | Soak, stress, and adversarial harnesses for long-running server stability. |
| [ ] | Replay capture and replay verification toolchain for deterministic reproduction. |
| [ ] | State diff and snapshot comparison tools for simulation and replication debugging. |
| [ ] | Memory and resource leak analysis tools for engine-owned objects and handles. |
| [ ] | Log correlation viewer for matching traces, state hashes, and failure markers. |
| [ ] | Failure reproduction runner that can execute a captured scenario locally. |

### 18.3 CI and Build Matrix
